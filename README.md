# sotheresthat-child
WordPress theme for So There's That, at www.sotheresthatblog.com, based on Serene by Elegant Themes.

This is a refactor of the previous theme for So There's That. The original theme was also
based on Serene by Elegant Themes, however no child theme was created. Bad idea! In order
for future updates to be integrated from the theme creators at Elegant Themes, I created
a child theme called So There's That and add all external functionality into it.

All functionality that was previously created in plugins are now added into the child 
theme's dedicated `functions.php`. Why? This particular site is not intended to 
distribute or monetize all the separate functions, especially since they are low-key
things like `related posts` and `'return to top button`. This code is available
in varying levels of cleanliness by way of a simple Google search, however it
is also a great learning tool to code it yourself.
